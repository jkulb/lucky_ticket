# lucky_ticket
When I was a kid someone told me that a ticket is lucky if it has an even number of digits N, 
and the sum of the first N/2 digits equals the sum of the last N/2 digits. So 1372 is not lucky and 
581257 is lucky. This code calculates the probability of receiving a lucky ticket if there are 
N tickets in the series
